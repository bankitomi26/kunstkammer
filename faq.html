           In my view the grey colour has a political aspect in Richter's art. While colorology does not count gray as color, Richter has an opportunity to reinterpret painting.

            So, if there is a chronological transition, you can’t really say that Gerhard Richter would have his photorealistic and abstract works from A. It’s like I started working in the abstract in the 1970s, but that’s when I flip through the Werg catalog. It's very interesting to see. In front of both, anytime, from the moment you do what you paint, abstract canvas man and abstract canvas, you flip through and suddenly you have a photorealistic landscape that you painted on the next page. So it all happens to him at once. And it was also a very big challenge for me during the preparation period, I have to say. Yes, because it is simply not so easy to grasp him with developments or phases, but it is very characteristic of Richter, which is exactly what he has always done, and with this work, of course, a demarcation and a proper account or carefully thought-out labels represent what is certainly very important in art history, very unique.

           So the biggest challenge for the exhibition for me, which was certainly the last stage of the exhibition, when, of course, we didn’t know for sure if the exhibition could still be opened, if we could still bring all the exhibitions to Vienna. Well, last year I experienced a lot of fears and hopes with the whole Kunstforum team. Of course, it has helped us a great deal that many, very many of Gerhard Richter's works are still in Central Europe, especially in Germany and Switzerland, and of course we have been able to facilitate these works here in Vienna in such circumstances. such as in the case of an artist where much of the work is located in the United States, for example. But I have to say that around September 20, we all went to Lasstsich. We opened on October 1st. By September 20, everything was simply here and we were ready to continue construction. And then quite a few stones fell from all kinds of hearts as we could then. It's there now, now physically, it's called there. And it was always this hope, the fear, that was important to me, the biggest challenge of the past year. And maybe I can join one of them right away. The previous tour you saw here at the show, during an art crisis, of course, is that something to say about this? This. This is crisis management, which art can also represent. Of course, you can look at two aspects. On the one hand, of course, the artist’s point of view. So I have heard from many artists that this pandemic situation and this needs to be separated and separated. Of course, this is not new to artists, but rather something that is, of course, pretty much the same here in everyday life. In this idea finding, which is expressed visually. For us as an audience, I think this art can be very, very valuable in the weeks of crisis, in many ways very, very valuable. And we still notice that. When we could reopen the exhibition. Lots and lots of visitors come in, and we’re right, it’s really good to find inspiration here, to be able to look at yourself, to get to places in these landscapes that you can’t get to right now. But at least I would get past this show. And I think so much that yes, yes, it can be a very, very big opportunity in a crisis, because, for those who do, and also those who watch.

            Unfortunately, this is an unanswered question, so there is no answer for you, this, question is of course a picture of Gerhard Richters who has become very, very famous as Betty, leaving her head behind as my portrait. But of course the viewer washed it out at our landscape exhibition, I have to tell myself that this is exactly what I can’t say, it’s a major work, but rather in Richter’s oeuvre, which is so incredibly diverse and complex. I hope you can make an impression on this. I just find this togetherness, this depth, balance, and this seriousness that is simply reflected, evolved, and something truly unique in this more than 60-year-old work. complete In that sense, I don't want, I don't really want to define any fully permissible work by Gerhard Richter, but I just think I think this is all we can show here for the herring that we hope you can experience today.
