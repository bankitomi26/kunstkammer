        <h3>Project Two</h3>
        <p>We shall speak of pompier painting– the term ‘pompier’ was part of the jargon of academic artists, or at least of the rapins – to refer to what today we might call ‘costume drama’, that is to say works representing people in classical dress. Faced with the productions of pompier art today, we are still implicated, we are not indifferent. We oscillate between condemning and rehabilitating this art. One might say that it is passé, done for, as people say today – in intellectual or artistic debates, the best way to shoot down your opponent is to tell him that he is finished, and to consign him to the past (either relegating him to classicism if you want to be kind, or telling him that he is past it, done for, when you want to finish him off). Pompier art is dismissed as archaic and outmoded, unless an attempt is made to rehabilitate it, as sometimes happens – indeed, this is an increasingly popular stance. Some will say that ‘At the end of the day, pompier art is not that bad’, and I could quote several perfectly eminent and respectable people who try to show in their writings that pompier art was in many ways not as detestable as people say – oddly enough, the conservative imagination is endless. Some emphasize the fact that pompier artists often came from more modest social stock than the revolutionaries who toppled them,which is true. This social paradox is interesting: when a universe is relatively autonomous in relation to the social order – i.e., when this universe is what I call a ‘field’, in my terminology – revolutionaries are often privileged, well-heeled people. Manet was an example of this phenomenon, and his revolutionary disposition certainly had something to do with the fact that he was born into privilege, and even more importantly, perhaps, that the success of the revolution he started – this is one of the arguments I am going to develop – would have been inconceivable if his considerable capital had consisted merely of the requisite academic and academically certified skills, and if he had not also had social capital, connections and therefore a certain amount of symbolic capital linked to his friends, etc. The matter I am raising with you is not over and done with, as historical debates so often suggest. If some have a tendency to adopt the ill-conceived perspective of historicism or relativism, which argues that there can be no historical truth, on the pretext that objective historical truth lies beyond the reach of the historian, since he is part of history, this is because historical debates – that is to say, debates among historians – remain rooted in social debates that to a greater or lesser extent are still burning issues today.</p>
